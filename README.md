# This is a personal project to learn and enhance my react, node, git and overall programming skills while using GPT as a personal assistant
# Some of the code was generated using GPT, however there is always my personal validation and error handling as well through the process
# I am just beginning so be nice
# I will try to use best prectices as much as possible and error and exception handling to my ability
# New features will keep coming
